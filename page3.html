            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">Globally, the United States leads in the death rate from opioid overdoses. Current trends suggest that the rate of opioid misuse and death will continue to grow. This project uses data from the Center for Disease Control and PreventionÕs Wonder database to visualize the opioid crisis in the United States. Specifically, the project seeks to visualize opioid deaths at the county level. Moreover, understanding that the origin of the opioid crisis began in the over prescription of opioids in the late 90s, this research seeks to investigate the relationship between opioid dispensing rates and opioid death rates in 2019. Understanding where the crisis is occurring and the connection between opioid prescriptions will help policy makers and healthcare workers make informed decisions about how to mitigate the opioid crisis and save lives. </p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">Renewable energy is the fastest growing energy source in the United States and solar photovoltaics are the single fastest growing electricity source. In the past decade solar costs have decreased rapidly and New York City has instituted policy measures, including Local Laws 92, 94 and 97, to speed up photovoltaic installation. This paper assesses current competing models of estimate solar PV rooftop potential and presents a case study using LiDAR data and GIS modeling to estimate the total PV potential and energy savings for one NYC neighborhood: Williamsburg, BK.</p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">Food apartheid in the United States has created a huge disparity in what communities have adequate access to fresh, healthy, and locally produced foods. Further, it has limited community control over local food systems. In working to overturn this system and promote food sovereignty, it is imperative that all communities regardless of race or income have the means to produce and consume local fresh food. This spatial analysis looks at how lower income communities are or are not currently able to access fresh local food. While there are some major successes in terms of access, some of the lowest income communities in the state are still very much cut off from the food being produced locally. Through this analysis, I worked to shine a light on the many areas that would benefit from shifts in policy or funding that would provide easier paths for new food sovereignty initiatives to be successful. </p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">In 1939, the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC) established a grading system to assess the relative credit and loan risk of neighborhoods across the United States. Today, they are widely understood as a tool for redlining -- which made it difficult or impossible for people in certain areas to become homeowners. As homeownership is a critical tool for intergenerational wealth building in the United States, the denial of loans to neighborhoods with “undesirable populations” has resulted in long-term disparities in wealth accumulation. The Mapping Inequality Project concluded that the practice of redlining “directed both public and private capital to native-born white families and away from African American and immigrant families.” The GIS spatial analysis summarized in this paper uses current socioeconomic and demographic census data to visualize the extent of these disparities. Using the areas rated “declining” or “hazardous” by HOLC as a boundary for analysis, I aim to illustrate the enduring effects these policies have today.</p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">In this project, I attempt to analyze the changes in the forested regions of the Arapaho National Forest in the Rocky Mountains from 2014 to 2020.  In this analysis, I've documented instances of forest loss due to Mountain Pine Beetle as well as wildfire and land use changes. In investigating how much pine-covered land has been affected, I was also interested in examining the relationship between Mountain Pine Beetle affected land and that with increased wildfires in the last three decades. In assessing the impact of the pine beetle, other factors that contribute to their overall impact on the pine population were present. Land use changes had a significant impact in the data that was assessed, and some of the land was difficult to distinguish. Similarly, land lost to forest fires was difficult to distinguish from possible beetle-affected areas due to similar colored pixels and a more organic shape of those areas. Areas suffering from droughts where trees died as a result were unable to be distinguished at all from the pine beetle classification. I examined the Arapaho National Forest area of the Rocky mountains, just west of Boulder, CO.</p>
