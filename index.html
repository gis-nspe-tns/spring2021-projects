            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">San Francisco is one of the largest and most influential coastal cities in the world. With water on three of four borders of the city, San Francisco could potentially be at major risk of flooding due to rising sea levels. Secondarily, San Francisco’s includes both social and economic disparities. Based on this spatial analysis project, it is found that social vulnerabilities intersect with 2100 flood projections at higher rates when compared to the city's population at large. These factors are important to consider when distributing aid and building climate resiliency for these flooding scenarios in the future.</p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">Since 2014, The dictatorial style Modi government does not shy away from a clampdown on civilians by using excessive force. One of the traumatic examples is from 05 Aug 2019, when the Modi Government amended the Indian Constitution and removed certain special rights granted to the residents of Jammu and Kashmir, which were temporarily granted under Articles 370 and 35A of the Constitution. This abrogation was implemented forcefully with allegedly more army personnel on the ground than the state's residents. The pro-government media shameless coins these violent clampdowns as 'masterstrokes'. There is a general sense of increased polarization in the country. Violence in the name of religion and cows, which are considered holy in Hinduism, has become more common than ever. The ruling party often uses compromised data visualizations to convey the stories in their favor to spread "positivity." This project uncovers the geographical locations where different types of political violence - riots and violence against civilians took place since 2016, the actors involved, the increase in violence since 2016, the worst affected areas, and essential population criteria for a riot or violence against civilian to occur.</p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">Energy infrastructure in Tanzania has been historically impacted by the lack of available funding and political cohesion for adequate development. Local populations in both urban and rural settings across the country often lack access to the infrastructure needed to meet basic demands. However, the country’s geographical location results in high potential for solar energy utilization given adequate sunlight exposure year-round. By examining potential for solar energy distribution across Tanzania in comparison to current population spread, this project intends to demonstrate which populations are currently at risk of inadequate access to energy infrastructure and where solar energy development may best support local needs while also taking advantage of available natural resources. The result is a spatial distribution analysis of solar energy potential against population spread to make this cross-comparison.</p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">This spatial analysis examines the impact of payday loan institutions in the city of Wichita, Kansas. Working with refugees there, I had noticed the clustering of such institutions in low-income areas of the city. I wanted to know if the anecdotal evidence I had seen was backed by financial and demographic data. In exploring the locations of payday lenders, I realized that to do real analysis, I needed more data than only those points. The answer was to create an adjusted score of financial access: with payday lenders and associated consumer complaints as negative points, and non-payday banks as positive points. Those scores were analyzed by zip code, categorized by score from 1 to 7, and compared to zip code average household income. I found that there was a correspondence between income and financial access. There was an average increase of nearly one point (.9227) for an increase in household income of $10,000.</p>

              <a class="text-dark">Mapping Rain Water in Africa in Comparison to its Population Density and Rate of Water Risks</a>
            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">In the face of climate change, population rates are rising and overconsumption is depleting resources that are already dwindling. Developing countries are facing the adverse effects of climate change and the actions of those from more developed countries. Ultimately resulting in the lack of basic access to resources that are necessary for human life such as food, energy, and water. As for water one of the most untapped resource potentials for water access is from natural rainfall harvesting. Viable rainwater harvesting systems have to be implemented in areas of dense rainfall and with some population density to be the most effective. For this GIS spatial analysis, I focused on the region of Africa as it is currently experiencing significant drought starting from 2018. Both datasets are compared atop Africa’s water duct structure and a basic land grid to understand the areas. Along with climate change effects, droughts have increased in frequency by 27%. Understanding an area's population density and the weather climate can aid in targeting hyperlocal solutions to provide access to food and water in the era of climate change. </p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">New York City has grown to be loved for its unique way of living so close together; it is a city that expands vertically. Due to the impacts of Covid, verticality becomes horizontality. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, “The Empire State's population fell by 126,355 people between July 2019 and July 2020, to 19.3 million, a drop of 0.65%, according to the preliminary figures. That's the most of any state by total and by percentage.” This drop in population continued as covid kept raging through the city. This GIS problem uses remote sensing to look at Rockland County to the north west of New York City to see the changes over time in the geography determining the percentage of development that occurred here from 2015-2020. </p>
