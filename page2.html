            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">With continuing efforts to transition our society’s energy source from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources, we need to understand and propose different methods for generating energy without further harming the environment. A rising contestant for new renewable energy sources is tidal energy. Recent technology advancements have allowed for upgrades in existing tidal energy equipment, increasing the efficiency of tidal energy generation. Tidal barrages in particular have shown success in providing renewable energy but require detailed planning due to high capital costs and time-consuming construction. GIS software and data from public sources on ocean data, population, and electricity infrastructure will be used to find suitable locations that meet the environmental requirements for building a tidal barrage on a global scale, in contrast to the smaller scale case-by-case research that has been traditionally conducted. The result of this map showcases 10 key focus areas that have met the chosen criteria for tidal barrage development.</p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">The commons (a general term for shared resources in which each stakeholder has an equal interest) shakes the shackles that contemporary capitalism seeks to impose. In NYC, Community gardens serve as commons, where dominant categories of private property, capital, money, profit and wage labor do not play a central role in them. Community gardens are abolitionist spaces and I am interested in understanding where they are located in the city and if their size plays any role in its distribution around the land. By mapping community gardens, the potential for community organizing and solidarity building becomes evident.</p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">Punjab is often termed as the bread basket of India, producing a majority of the country’s rice and wheat crops every year. With nearly 90 per cent of the state’s land cover under agricultural use, Punjabi farmers constitute a large portion of the population. This project explores the extent of transformation of land into agricultural use, and forms a sliver of a larger research exploration into the makeup of types of farms in Punjab (and India as a whole), and the brunt that smallholder farmers bear in the wake of the latest farm laws being introduced by the central government. Farmers across the country, but specifically from Punjab, have been protesting on the streets of Delhi for nearly a year since mid-2020 in opposition to these laws. This project also looked into the data on conflict in the country since 2018, to trace the protest duration and makeup. </p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">This project features facilities for water access and sanitation in the Mukuru informal settlement of Nairobi Kenya. I’m interested in identifying the different points that are spread throughout the Mukuru region so as to gain some idea of the spatial relation between water and sanitation facilities and specifically the Ngong River - an important source of water in Mukuru.  Of particular concern, the river may be impacted by its proximity to these facilities and therefore how that would likely increase the risk of water pollution subjecting residents to greater public health risks. </p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">Spanning only 9.01 miles, Fire Island is an important barrier island off the south shore of Long Island, NY. In 2012, Hurricane Sandy had significant impacts on Fire Island, creating record breaking storm surges, damage to homes and businesses, and breaches in the island. Sandy also led to the erosion of sand dunes due to high winds combined with storm surge. Additionally, Fire Island experienced overwash from Sandy, where sand was carried from coastal areas to areas more inland. This project analyzes these components within the time period of 2008 to 2013, to emphasize the change over time of sand cover on Fire Island pre and post Hurricane Sandy. The data provides a spatial view of overwash and sand cover change during this time period, while also highlighting the significant breach of the Island. This project measures this change in sand cover for the whole Island, in addition to each town that Fire Island spans across- Babylon, Islip and Brookhaven. The results show that there has been an overall decrease in sand cover on the Island between 2008 and 2013, which can most likely be attributed to erosion and overwash from Hurricane Sandy.</p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">This project investigates AI-related patent filings by geographic region in the United States between 2016-2020 to better understand the landscape and asymmetries existing throughout regional clusters. We observe links between counties to better understand the “clusters” which develop and the demographic and economic statistics within each region. Inventions are signals from the future, as much as they are from the past. They provide us with a barometer for measuring the patterns of economic activity, policy direction, and competitive moat-building by international companies and governments across the world. These visual explorations will serve to enrich our understanding of where “machine learning” technologies are being created by looking at Patent data and the underlying regional data occurring within these locations.</p>
